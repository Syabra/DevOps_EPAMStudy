Task:

    Remember that tricky practice task, that we had last fifth lection? Great! So, you should make it little bit more user-friendly, like show only the result of work. For now, script shows all his journey, including wrong path passed on the screen step-by-step. You should make it show only the picture with the answer path. That's all!

Self-review:

    Well, you'll see only one picture with right pass to exit. Nothing more, nothing less.

Additional points:

    I don't think, that you'll ever need additional lists, sets, tuples or dictionaries. Everything you need is already in the script.
